# Manglish Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of **Manglish Sentiment Analysis**, a part of my MSc project on **Multilingual Sentiment Analysis of Instagram Comments: Exploring Malayalam, English, Manglish, and Emoji Usage**.  
The project focuses on handling **Manglish (Malayalam written in English script)** text, which poses unique challenges in preprocessing, tokenization, and sentiment classification.
